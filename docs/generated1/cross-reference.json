  "_project_goal": "### Project Goal Statement\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a robust chess game management system that integrates with a language model (LLM) to facilitate automated gameplay and analysis. The system will support various configurations for both human and AI opponents, allowing for flexible game setups and interactions. Key objectives include:\n\n1. **Game Configuration**: Implement a configuration management system that allows users to specify game parameters, including model selection, opponent type, game depth, and output paths. This will be achieved through a user-friendly interface that accepts JSON configuration files.\n\n2. **Game Execution**: Develop a game execution engine that can run multiple chess games either sequentially or in parallel, depending on user preferences. The engine will handle the application of moves, game state management, and result tracking.\n\n3. **Move Validation**: Integrate a move validation system that ensures all moves made by the AI or human players are legal according to the current state of the chessboard. This will involve parsing moves in both UCI and SAN formats and providing clear feedback on invalid moves.\n\n4. **Logging and Metrics**: Implement comprehensive logging and metrics collection to track game performance, including move legality rates, execution times, and game outcomes. This data will be used for analysis and improvement of the AI's decision-making capabilities.\n\n5. **User Interaction**: Create a user interface that allows for easy interaction with the chess game, including move submission, game status updates, and result displays. The interface will support both human players and AI opponents, providing a seamless experience.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Robustness**: Ensure that the system is resilient to errors, with appropriate error handling mechanisms in place to manage invalid inputs, network issues, and other potential failures during gameplay.\n\nBy achieving these objectives, the project aims to create a comprehensive chess game management system that leverages AI capabilities to enhance gameplay and provide valuable insights into chess strategies and decision-making processes."
