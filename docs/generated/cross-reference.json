  "_project_goal": "**Project Goal Statement:**\n\nThe objective of this project is to develop a robust task management system encapsulated within two primary classes: `Task` and `TaskList`. The `Task` class will serve as a representation of individual to-do items, tracking essential attributes such as the task title, completion status, and creation timestamp. It will provide functionality to mark tasks as completed, ensuring that the system can accurately reflect the current state of each task.\n\nThe `TaskList` class will manage a collection of `Task` instances, enabling users to add new tasks, retrieve lists of pending and completed tasks, and calculate the overall completion ratio of tasks. This class will facilitate the organization and tracking of tasks, providing a user-friendly interface for task management.\n\nAdditionally, a utility function, `bootstrap_demo_list`, will be implemented to create and return a pre-populated `TaskList` for demonstration purposes, showcasing the functionality of the task management system.\n\nThe project will prioritize clear structure, efficient data handling, and basic error handling to ensure a reliable user experience. The final deliverable will be a well-documented codebase that allows for easy extension and integration into larger applications, while also providing a solid foundation for task management functionalities."
